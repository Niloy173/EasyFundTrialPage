            Under this category, it is very recommendable to add frequent updates in your project, explaining about the community you want to support 
            and how committed you are to this cause, sharing the latest news and activities.
          </p>

          <p>
            Share it through social media like Facebook to reach a bigger audience, and contact the people directly related to the community, to ask for their participation. Also, you can set an example by supporting your own project, 
            to show that you are actively cooperating with your cause!

            The perfect starting point for you, is to share your project with your 
            closest people. Explain to them how they can help, step by step, and ask 
            them also to share your project with their own friends. Asking for financial 
            help can be awkward, but don’t forget that the people that love you are the 
            people that will help you no matter what.

            There will always be people that can relate to your story around the world. That’s why it is very important to share your project through social media.
