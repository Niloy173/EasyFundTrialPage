            Under this category, it is very recommendable to add frequent
            updates in your project, explaining about the community you want to
            support and how committed you are to this cause, sharing the latest
            news and activities.
          </p>

          <p>
            Share it through social media like Facebook to reach a bigger
            audience, and contact the people directly related to the community,
            to ask for their participation. Also, you can set an example by
            supporting your own project, to show that you are actively
            cooperating with your cause!

            friends. Asking for financial help can be awkward, but don’t forget
            that the people that love you are the people that will help you no
